# Java-course-projects

A few projects I did with a partner in university.

### Core Wars

This program simulates the 1984 assembly language based game Core Wars. The program reads text inputs as the assembly commands and emulates the game as it was originally played. This version supports two player combat.

### Tetris

A very basic clone of the popular block game. This version was built in Android Studio. In order to build the project and play it, you must use Android Studio. Once built, use the touchscreen controls to play the game. 

### Not_Mario

A three level clone of a very famous platform game. This project was built in Android Studio. While made for touch controls, arrow key movement was added so that the program can be played with the keyboard.
